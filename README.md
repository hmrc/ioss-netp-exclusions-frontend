This is the repository for Import One Stop Shop Netp Exclusions Frontend

Backend: https://github.com/hmrc/ioss-netp-registration

Stub: https://github.com/hmrc/ioss-netp-registration-stub

Exclusions Service
------------
The main function of this service is to allow traders who are registered with the Import One Stop Shop Netp Registration
service to leave the Import One Stop Shop service, if they are no longer eligible to use it.


Requirements
------------

This service is written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Play](http://playframework.com/), so needs at least a [JRE] to run.

## Run the application locally via Service Manager

```
sm2 --start IMPORT_ONE_STOP_SHOP_ALL
```

### To run the application locally from the repository, execute the following:

```
sm2 --stop IOSS_NETP_EXCLUSIONS_FRONTEND
```
and
```
sbt run
```

### Running correct version of mongo
Mongo 6 with a replica set is required to run the service. Please refer to the MDTP Handbook for instructions on how to run this

### Using the application

Access the Authority Wizard to log in:
http://localhost:9949/auth-login-stub/gg-sign-in

Enter the following details on this page and submit:
- Redirect URL: http://localhost:10176/pay-clients-vat-on-eu-sales/leave-import-one-stop-shop-netp

- Identifier Name: VRN
- Identifier Value: 100000001
- Enrolment Key: HMRC-IOSS-INT

It is recommended to use VRN 100000001 and Int Number IN9001234567 for a regular exclusions journey, however
alternatives can be found in the ioss-netp-registration-stub which holds scenarios for registered traders and any
existing exclusions.
